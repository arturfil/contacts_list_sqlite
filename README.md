# contacts_list_sqlite

This is a project where I create a contact's list in order to learn about sqlite/core data.

I will explore and familiarize with CRUD methods in a simple yet fun way which later can be applied

into other projects. In addition I will make use of list views inside list views which are basic and

crucial for Android development.
